# On being a student at Dev Bootcamp

As a student, a lot of questions start to crop up in your first week onsite. "How many cores should I complete?", "should I favor completion or understanding?", "how many hours should I work?", or "what do I need to know to pass the assessment?" 

These are great questions, and we'd like to address them.

First, we assume the following:

 * You're here to change your life in 9 weeks
 * You're here because you love programming and want to do it for a living
 * You're here because you want to learn
 * You're here to work hard because _you_ want to, not because we tell you to

Dev Bootcamp looks a lot like a school, but the truth is it's something very different. There are no grades and no degrees. The only thing you will leave this place with is the ability to learn technical material quickly, effectively, and with minimal guidance. These are the qualities you must strive to develop, and they are some of the crucial qualities that set great junior developers apart from their peers. We can't supply you with motivation, the only way to be successful here is to _want_ to be here.

There is no metric for "done" at Dev Bootcamp because your work is never done. Finishing your cores doesn't mean you're "done" because there are stretch challenges. Finishing stretch challenges doesn't mean you're "done" because you can start a side-project. Finishing a side-project doesn't mean you're "done" because our code is never done — with guidance, it can always be improved.

Passing an assessment doesn't mean you're done either. There is more material ahead of you, and more material behind you that could benefit from reflection, refactoring, and further comprehension.

Repeating or being on track to repeat doesn't mean you're done. Every second counts, and you should use your time to strengthen your weaknesses and advance your strengths.

If you're having a hard day or a hard week, don't despair. Keep pushing and do the best you can. Comparing yourself to others will not help you learn faster.

If you're having an easy week, do not feel confident and do not feel comfortable. Feel _uncomfortable_ that you could be pushing harder but you are not.

If you're pushing hard enough, you will find that opportunities to grab a drink with a friend, spend quality time with your partner, or go to the movies will be few and far between. Remember, this program is immersive. If you're finding yourself with the time to do these things, please pause and reflect on how you've been spending your time at Dev Bootcamp, because you may not be pushing enough.

Make no mistake, finishing cores will not get you a job. Finishing them quickly will not get you a job. Passing the assessment will not get you a job. Employers do not care about the work you do here, they care about the person you are when you exit. You are attempting to learn a body of material that takes most people years. You are attempting to be competitive in a market made up of experienced programmers, juniors from other bootcamps, and CS grads. Do not allow yourself to become confident or comfortable, because you cannot afford it. You are here to learn as much as you possibly can before you exit to increase your odds of getting hired as a junior dev. Many of our grads find employment, but some do not. We are here to support you in your learning and in your job search, but ultimately this is up to _you_.

So what guideline can we provide? If it's not the assessment, or the number of cores you finish, or the number of technologies you become comfortable with, then how can you judge if you're "doing things right?"

All we can offer is this. Every night, before you go to sleep, pause and reflect on the day and ask yourself this question:

> "Did I work as hard I possibly could have without sacrificing my mental and physical health today?"

If the answer is "no, I could have worked harder", ask yourself _why_ that is, and then ask yourself _how_ you can push harder.

If the answer is "yes, I worked as hard as I could", ask yourself if there are habits, behaviors or life factors you can adjust that will give you even more time, energy, focus, or efficiency. Sometimes the answer may be no, but you must ask the question.

With this in mind, let's revisit those questions we started with:

> "How many cores should I complete?"

If you're pushing yourself as hard as you can, you will get as many cores done as you possibly can, and you will work to make up the ones you miss.

> "Should I favor completion or understanding?"

You should favor both. This program was designed for completion, we know it's completable, and we've seen it completed. This is what you're here to do.

> "How many hours should I work?"

As many as you can while maintaining your health. You will find your own ways to manage your health here. They will be different for everyone. We can't tell you how to take care of yourself, but we're here to listen when it gets hard. Our onsite counselor is an invaluable resource.

> "What do I need to know to pass the assessment?"

A better question is, "what do I need to know to be a junior developer?" Keep your focus on this end goal at all times and it will help guide you. Passing an assessment will not make you a junior developer, and cramming for one won't either.

Assessments at Dev Bootcamp are not a way of testing your knowledge, they're a way for us to determine what you need in the next stage of your learning. Some students will be ready at the end of a phase to learn new content, others will need to invest more time in the content they've already been exposed to. Both outcomes are normal, acceptable, and positive. Both outcomes are in pursuit of your ultimate goal — to become a programmer.

Your guiding lights at Dev Bootcamp are present but few. Please keep them in mind:

At all times, be honest with yourself and with others.

At all times, be kind to yourself and others.

At all times, bring your whole self to bear on the problems in front of you. There is a piece of each of you that knows what it means to work tirelessly and relentlessly. Find it and embrace it. We have created a space and community designed to support individuals who embark on a journey of extraordinary effort, and we're here to help guide you on that journey. The rest is up to you.
